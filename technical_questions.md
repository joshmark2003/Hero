# Technical questions

1. Spent 2 hours 45 minutes
2. If I had more time:
* Would have added a loading spinner to inform the user that something is happening 
* Would have added an icon for the app
* Would have added more sorting options with corresponding Tests
* Would have created a custom drop down list for the sort options instead of using action sheet
* Would have had the table view scroll to the top when sort option is selected
